      "Solun has two modes. Quick pastes are AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest with a server-side key and deleted after the first read — zero effort for the sender. Secure pastes are end-to-end encrypted in the browser via the Web Crypto API; the decryption key lives only in the URL fragment and is never transmitted to the server. Both modes are burn-after-read by default. The stack is a pnpm monorepo: Next.js 16 frontend, Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL API, deployed via Docker. Available as a hosted service at solun.pm and fully self-hostable under MIT.",

    details:
      "Every hosting provider that gives you a /64 IPv6 subnet hands you 18 quintillion addresses. NyxProxy puts them to work: a pre-populated pool of 200 IPs is kept ready, each replaced after 100 uses or 30 minutes. The result is a different exit IP per request with no coordination overhead. Single-IP proxies get rate-limited, fingerprinted, and blocked. NyxProxy makes each request look like a different user. Written in Go, MIT-licensed, ships with a one-command Debian/Ubuntu installer and a systemd unit. Typical use cases: web scraping without rate limits, multi-user API testing, and privacy-conscious browsing.",

A Raspberry Pi Pico running CircuitPython acts as a USB HID keyboard and executes a Ducky Script payload that applies the Windows registry entry needed to enable TLS 1.2 for Uni-Paderborn user certificates. Plug in, wait half a second, done — no manual steps. A GPIO jumper puts the device into setup mode so you can edit the payload without it triggering on your own machine.",
